# Angelfish Records

This repository contains the official website for **Angelfish Records**, serving as the public-facing gateway for the label’s corporate identity, catalogue overview, and merchandise.

The site is intentionally minimal. Its purpose is to provide clear, durable access to label information, artist links, and commercial touchpoints, rather than to function as a community platform or primary listening destination. Deeper artist experiences, releases, and fan interactions live on dedicated artist sites.

This codebase prioritises clarity, longevity, and ease of maintenance, and is designed to remain stable as the label’s roster, catalogue, and commercial activity evolve.
